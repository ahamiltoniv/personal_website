	<p>The Avalon Hill website uses primarily javascript objects. Although I don't <em>yet</em> know much about that, I can say that I think the Avalon Hill website is pretty good. It's very visual, very kinetic, and certainly gets your attention. It's also pretty easy to navigate as you simply mouse over and click what you want to find more information on.</p> -->
